### Summary:

For this project, we’re going to take the simple button program we’ve worked on earlier this week; and turn it into an annoying button, similar to the early web flash game, *Do Not Push The Red Button*:

We’ve shown you already how to interact with JavaScript & Change Buttons, now the options on how you make your button more annoying are up to you.

### Making your Annoying Button more Annoying-er:


You’ve got a budget of 5 points, you can spend more, but you need at least that total amount in additional features. 
  

Remember, you can look up how to add new features to your annoying button BUT, there is a difference between following a tutorial or guide, and ripping code off of a website. If you want to use something, make sure it is typed through your hands, documented, and you know how it functions. Mr. Meade and Mr. Costantino may ask you to elaborate on a feature and it’s up to you to explain how it works.


| Feature                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Points |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Catch Me If You Can                             | Button moves around the screen in a consistent manner, trying to avoid the mouse or based on a movement pattern. Stops once the user is able to click on the button.                                                                                            | 2      |
| Instant Transmission                            | The button instantly teleports to another location on screen when clicked.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2      |
| Which One Is Real?                              | The button spawns multiple, similar looking buttons. Only one of these buttons is the real one, and when clicked, the others vanish.<br><br>  <br><br>( make sure this one doesn’t mess up your page organization. Everything should still be center-justified) | 1      |
| One Button, Two Button, Red Button, Blue Button | Spawn in a new, separately colored button. This button shares different behavior than the annoying button.                                                                                                                                                      | 1      |
| Sound Effect                                    | The button makes a noise when clicked.<br><br> (School appropriate sound effects, please. Failing to do this will not count as a point).                                                                                                                        | 1      |
| Big Button, Little Button                       | The button grows and/or shrinks in size, making it easier/harder to click on.                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1      |
| Anti-Click                                      | The button does not respond to mouse clicks. Instead, the user has to type “C-L-I-C-K” or “P-R-E-S-S” on their keyboard.                                                                                                                                        | 3      |
| Dancing Buttons                                 | One or more buttons orbits around the other, and the user has to click them while moving.                                                                                                                                                                       | 2      |
| Dash                                            | The user must click every button on screen within a certain time limit.                                                                                                                                                                                         | 3      |
| Free Space                                      | Add a new feature all on your own! You can do this multiple times, but each new feature must be distinct from the others.                                                                                                                                       | 1      |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |        |
